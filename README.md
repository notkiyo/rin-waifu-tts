## TTS Model Project Plan

### Objectives:
- Create a lightweight TTS model that runs efficiently on a CPU.
- Fine-tune the model to produce a high-quality, cute anime girl voice.
- Develop a comprehensive dataset for training and fine-tuning.

### Steps and Considerations:

1. **Model Selection and Optimization**:
   - **Lightweight Architecture**: Choose or modify a TTS model architecture that is computationally efficient. Consider models like Tacotron 2, FastSpeech, or Glow-TTS, and optimize them for CPU usage.
   - **Quantization**: Explore model quantization techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference speed on CPUs.

2. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - **Character Selection**: Identify and select characters with desirable voice qualities. Here are some characters to consider:
     - [Rikka Takanashi](https://anilist.co/character/65865/Rikka-Takanashi)
     - [Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou](https://anilist.co/character/217334/Alisa-Mikhailovna-Kujou)
     - [Kurumi Tokisaki](https://anilist.co/character/70069/Kurumi-Tokisaki)
     - [Rim](https://anilist.co/character/206201/Rim)
     - [RyuZU](https://anilist.co/character/88234/RyuZU)
     - [Aki-Shino](https://anilist.co/character/197116/Aki-Shino)
   - **Audio Collection**: Gather high-quality audio clips of these characters. Ensure the clips are:
     - **Duration**: Cut to 1 minute each.
     - **Format**: Converted to WAV format.
     - **Cleaning**: Remove background noise and any irrelevant sounds.
   - **Annotation**: Transcribe the audio clips to create text-audio pairs for training.

3. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - **Pre-trained Models**: Start with pre-trained TTS models and fine-tune them using your dataset.
   - **Loss Functions**: Use appropriate loss functions to ensure the model's output closely matches the target voice.
   - **Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and character error rate (CER).

4. **Integration**:
   - **LLM Integration**: Plan how to integrate the TTS model with a language model (LLM) for generating coherent and contextually appropriate speech.
   - **API Development**: Develop an API to interact with the TTS model, allowing for easy integration with other applications.

5. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - **Diverse Testing**: Test the model with a variety of texts, including light novels, manga, and other content.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Collect feedback and iterate on the model to improve its performance and naturalness.

6. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - **Permissions**: Ensure you have the right to use the audio clips in your dataset.
   - **Responsible Use**: Be mindful of the ethical implications of creating synthetic voices and use the technology responsibly.

### Next Steps:
- **Research**: Explore existing TTS models and their CPU optimization techniques.
- **Data Collection**: Start collecting and processing audio clips for the selected characters.
- **Tool Setup**: Set up the necessary tools and environments for model training and fine-tuning.
